# Game of Three

![CI/CD](https://github.com/mehul9595/game-of-three-client/workflows/CI/CD%20game-of-three/badge.svg)

Game of three is a fun game played with multiplayer or computer. The game is currently hosted on Azure, you can try out the live demo [here.](https://game-of-three.azurewebsites.net) Site can be also accessed through it's [CDN here](https://game-of-three.azureedge.net).

This project is built with:

- [React + Bootstrap with Create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Ant Design Components](https://ant.design/)
- [NodeJS Backend](https://github.com/mehul9595/game-of-three-server)
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

## Description

When a player starts, they incept a random (whole) number and send it to the second player as an
approach of starting the game. The receiving player can then choose between adding one of {-1,0,1} in
order to get to a number that is divisible by 3. The resulting whole number is then sent back to the original
sender.
The same rules are applied until one player reaches the number 1 (after the division. See example
[here](https://invis.io/JHN2247E9MK).)

For each "move", a sufficient output should be generated (mandatory: the added, and the resulting
number).
Both players should be able to play automatically without user input. One of the players should optionally
be adjustable by a user.
